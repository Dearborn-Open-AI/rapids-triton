# Using RAPIDS-Triton

To begin developing a custom backend with RAPIDS-Triton, we strongly recommend
that you take advantage of the [rapids-triton-template
repo](https://github.com/rapidsai/rapids-triton-template), which provides a
basic template for your backend code. For a detailed example of how to make use
of this template, check out the [Linear Example
repo](https://github.com/rapidsai/rapids-triton-linear-example), which provides
a complete walkthrough of how to build a backend using RAPIDS-Triton
